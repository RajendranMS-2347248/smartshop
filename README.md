Case Study: Transforming XML Data with XSL and Validating with XSD
Scenario:
You are working for a fictional e-commerce company called "ShopSmart," and they have recently revamped their product catalog. The product data is stored in XML format and needs to be transformed into a more user-friendly HTML format for display on their website. Additionally, they want to ensure that the transformed data adheres to a predefined XML schema for validation purposes.
Your task is to create an XSL stylesheet to transform the product data from the XML format into HTML and validate it against a corresponding XSD schema.
Instructions:
You will be provided with a sample XML product catalog file (products.xml) containing product information. Here's a simplified snippet:
xmlCopy code
<products>
<product>
<id>1</id>
<name>Laptop</name>
<price>999.99</price>
<description>Powerful laptop with great features.</description>
</product>
<!-- More product entries -->
</products>

Create an XSL stylesheet (transform.xsl) that transforms the XML product data into HTML. Your HTML output should display each product's name, price, and description in a user-friendly format.
Create an XML Schema Definition (product_schema.xsd) for the product data. Define rules and constraints for the product elements, such as making sure that the price element contains valid numeric values.
Write a script or program in a language of your choice (e.g., Python, Java, or XSLT processor) that performs the following tasks:
Applies your XSL stylesheet to the products.xml data to generate an HTML file.
Validates the transformed HTML data against the product_schema.xsd to ensure it adheres to the defined structure and rules.

Provide a summary report of the transformation and validation process. Include any errors or issues encountered during validation.
Test your solution with various scenarios, including cases where data in products.xml violates the schema rules.
Document your solution, including the purpose of the XSL stylesheet, XSD schema, and the script or program you used for transformation and validation.
Implement error handling to capture and report any validation errors and provide suggestions for correcting them.
This case study will not only demonstrate your ability to work with XSL and XSD but also showcase your skills in data transformation, validation, and documentation.
